        The stacked bar chart shows missing persons across different states categorized by biological sex. Each bar on the chart represents a state, with the height of the bar indicating the total count of missing persons. The bars are divided into male and female, showing the distribution of missing persons by sex within each state. We see that California has the highest total count of missing persons and the highest counts of male and female of any state.

California and Texas show as the darkest shades on the map, indicating that these states have the highest numbers of missing persons based on our dataset from NamUS. It could also prompt further investigation into the underlying factors contributing to the higher prevalence of missing persons in these specific areas, such as population density, social dynamics, or law enforcement resources.

      <h1 class="paragraph">The scattergeo map provides a visual representation of missing persons counts at both the city and state levels. The dense concentration of dots along the northeast coast, particularly in states like New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, suggests a higher prevalence of missing persons cases in this region. Additionally, scattered dots along the west coast, notably in California, indicate another area with a high number of missing persons. The geographical distribution of these dots may reflect various factors such as population density, urbanization, and socio-economic conditions, all of which can influence the occurrence and reporting of missing persons. This visualization is valuable for identifying geographic patterns and hotspots.</h1>

This intensified color suggests that Alaska faces a pronounced challenge with missing persons cases compared to the rest of the United States. The choropleth map excluding Alaska shows Wyoming and Maine as the darkest colors, indicating a higher proportion of missing persons relative to its population.</h1>

Each state is color-coded based on its respective average violent crime rate per 100,000 population, with darker shades indicating higher crime rates. Alaska and New Mexico appear as the darkest shades showing that these states have higher average violent crime rates compared to others. The second map excludes Alaska when showing the distribution. The ratio is calculated by multiplying the average violent crime rate by the proportion of missing persons per 100,000 population. Darker shades on the map signify higher ratios, with New Mexico and Tennessee standing out as the states with the highest values. This indicates a higher intersection of elevated violent crime rates and a notable proportion of missing persons in these areas. </h1>

The ratio is calculated by multiplying the average violent crime rate by the proportion of missing persons per 100,000 population to understand the prevalence of violent crime and the incidence of missing persons relative to the population size. Alaska stands out as the state with the highest ratio meaning that there is a potential correlation between elevated violent crime rates and a significant proportion of missing persons in the state.</h1>

The majority of states cluster around a proportion of approximately 0.2 missing persons per 100,000 population. However, Alaska is the outlier at 1.74 missing persons per 100,000 a high average violent crime rate and a substantial proportion of missing persons relative to its population.
